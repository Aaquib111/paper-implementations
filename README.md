# Paper Implementations!

This is a general repository for me to store my implementations of popular model architectures/cool papers I find while doing AI research. 
Currently all of these implementations are all over the place, but I'm planning on cleaning up and aggregating them here to help others who may be looking for implementations
and to improve at JAX and C++.
